#+title: The Phantom of the XY-Plane
#+subtitle: The Geometry of Quadratic Functions and their Complex Roots

I recently realized that I had never learned any kind of geometric
intuition for the complex roots of quadratic functions. That seemed
odd to me. Not that I needed one neccesarily. I was always happy to
just accept complex roots as a consequence of the algebra and get on
with my life. But it still seemed strange.

The geometric meaning of /real/ roots is easy: It's just the points
where the function crosses the x-axis. Why didn't I have—or why was I
never taught—a similarly straight-forward geometric interpretation for
complex roots? Was it just that there wasn't one? That didn't seem
right.

Once I'd thought to ask the question, finding one wasn't all that
hard. In hindsight it actually seems pretty obvious. My first thought
was, "hey, that's really neat!" followed almost immediately by, "well
of course that's what it is. What else could it possibly have been?
Duh."

It seemed so obvious that I seriously considered not writing this at
all. Maybe it /is/ really obvious and I've just somehow managed to
miss it entirely for twenty-odd years. That's entirely possible but,
in the end, if I've missed it, probably other people have too and
hopefully someone finds it interesting.

There's more to see if you've the got the time or inclination but I
don't want to waste anybody's time so I'll cut to the chase.

_*Geometric Interpretation of Complex Roots - The Phantom Parabola*_

A quadratic function can be thought of as having a "phantom"—or
imaginary—parabola associated with it. For quadratic function $f$ with
minimum (or maximum) point at coordinates $(x_{min}, y_{min})$, the
phantom is constructed by reflecting $f$ across the line $y = y_{min}$
and then translating so it's centered on the y-axis.

Then $f$ has complex (or purely imaginary) roots if and only if its
phantom crosses the x-axis: The real part of the solution is $x_{min}$;
the coefficients of the imaginary parts are the roots of the
phantom.

* The Geometry of Quadratic Functions
When we were first introduced to quadratics at my school we spent a
bit of time graphing, transforming and translating them around the
plane. But not much. I don't think we ever really referenced the
actual geometry of parabolas again. It was all algebra, all the time.


When it was time to start finding roots we naturally started with
functions that had real roots. The very first technique we learned was
factoring the function into a pair of binomials, $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$,
from which we could see the roots were $r_1$ and $r_2$.  Once
we got good at factoring, we met quadratics that were not easily
factored and learned about completing the square. And once we'd well
and truly mastered /that/, we were walked through how to use it to
derive the quadratic formula. We weren't actually required to know how
to derive the quadratic formula though. We were just told to memorize
it. Missing from this list is a way to find roots without using /any/
of those methods but just a few simple geometric facts about
quadratics.

** The Simplest Quadratic Formula (real roots)
There's /the/ quadratic formula and there's even a [[https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/06/131673/a-new-way-to-make-quadratic-equations-easy/][simple quadratic
formula]]; I propose the "simplest" quadratic formula. At least for
quadratics of the form $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$. It's so simple, in fact,
that I feel like it's kind of a, "missing the forest for the trees,"
situation. The derivation of the simple quadratic formula I just
linked to uses this fact but just drives right on past without
pointing out the relevant geometry. Or perhaps the relevant geometry
just doesn't /seem/ relevant.

#+begin_theorem
_*The Simplest Quadratic Formula*_

For quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$, the real roots are
horizontally symmetric around the function's minimum point. The
/horizontal/ distance from the minimum to a root is the square root of
the minimum point's /vertical/ distance below the x-axis.

If the function's minimum point has coordinates $(x_{min}, y_{min})$
then it's roots are found at:


\begin{align}
\label{eq:simplest-quad-formula}
x &= x_{min} \pm \sqrt{-y_{min}}
\end{align}

It's the square root of $-y_{min}$ because for quadratics of the given
form with real roots, $y_{min}$ will always be below the x-axis—always
negative—so $\sqrt{-y_{min}}$ will always be a real rather than
imaginary number.

[[file:images/geo-real.png]]
#+end_figure
#+end_theorem

We're already getting into, "isn't that kind of obvious?"
territory. I mean, it's /right there/ staring us in the face. But for
some reason this was never presented, at least in my school, as a way
to find the roots.

I say this is the simplest quadratic formula not just because it has
fewer terms than the others, which it does, but because those terms
are related to a significant geometric property of the function which
makes it more than just a mish-mash of symbols to memorize. It's so
simple that even if students somehow manage to forget it, they can
derive it for themselves as long as they can remember the basic idea
of using the minimum as a landmark and sketch some version
of Figure [[fig:real-geo-roots]].

Of course, all of this begs the question of how to actually /find/ the
minimum but that's actually pretty easy. Just a bit more geometric
reasoning will get us there.

First of all, $y_{min}$ is just $f(x_{min})$ so we can rewrite
(\ref{eq:simplest-quad-formula}) as

\begin{align*}
x = x_{min} \pm \sqrt{-f(x_{min})}
\end{align*}

so the only thing we actually need to find is $x_{min}$.

Since quadratics are symmetric $x_{min}$ will always be the halfway
between the real roots $r_1$ and $r_2$. That is,

\begin{align}
\label{eq:root-average}
x_{min} = \frac{r_1 + r_2}{2}.
\end{align}

The function itself can be constructed by multiplying binomials,

\begin{align}
f(x) &= (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \nonumber \\
\label{fn:quad-from-roots}
&= x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2
\end{align}

which gives a quadratic of the same form as the one used to construct
(\ref{eq:simplest-quad-formula}). From (\ref{fn:quad-from-roots}) we
have the coefficient
\begin{align*}
b = -(r_1 + r_2).
\end{align*}

Dividing both sides by $-2$ gives
\begin{align*}
\frac{b}{-2} = \frac{r_1 + r_2}{2}.
\end{align*}

So by (\ref{eq:root-average}),
\begin{align}
\label{def:x-min}
x_{min} = \frac{-b}{2}.
\end{align}

So you have some quadratic $f$ and need to find it's roots? No problem:

Find the roots of $f(x) = x^2 +bx + c$.

First find $x_{min}$,

\end{align*}

Then find $y_{min}$,

\begin{align*}
y_{min} &= f(x_{min}) \\
&= \left(\frac{-b}{2}\right)^2 + b\left(\frac{-b}{2}\right) + c\\
&= \frac{b^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{2} + c\\
&= \frac{b^2 - 2b^2}{4} + c\\
&= -\frac{b^2}{4} + c
\end{align*}

Then the roots are at,
\begin{align*}
x &= x_{min} \pm \sqrt{-y_{min}}\\
&= -\frac{b}{2} \pm \sqrt{-\left(-\frac{b^2}{4} + c\right)}\\
&= -\frac{b}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4} - c}.
\end{align*}

This is the simple quadratic formula and it is—at least in my
opinion—an even easier derivation than the one linked above with each
term's relationship to the function's minimum made clear.
#+end_theorem

** The Simplest Quadratic Formula (complex roots)
We got to equation (\ref{eq:simplest-quad-formula}) from the geometry
of /real/ roots. What about complex roots? Is it the same formula?
Spoilers: yes. But let's pretend we don't know that.

The intuition is not so obvious in this case.

*** Pure Imaginary Inputs
Instead of just applying the formula to a function—say $f(x) = x^2 -
2x + 5$—and having it spit out an inexplicable complex answer that we
don't know how to interpret, let's approach it from the other
direction. Let's extend $f$ to the imaginary numbers: $ai, \forall a
\in \mathbb{R}$, and see if we learn anything useful.

We'll start off nice and easy and see what happens for $f(x) =
x^2$.
For a typical input $ai$ we get,
\begin{align*}
f(ai) = (ai)^2 = -a^2.
\end{align*}

I know, you're shocked.

The point isn't that this is a surprising result—because it isn't—but
rather about what it implies about imaginary and complex roots. I'll
graph it on the complex plane. Or at least /a/ complex plane. I'm
going to break a bit with tradition here: I want to graph inputs on
the horizontal axis so, since I'm taking imaginary numbers as inputs,
I'll make the /horizontal/ axis the imaginary axis and the vertical
axis will still be the (real) y-axis. I'll also overlay the real
valued function on top for comparison.

#+begin_figure
#+name: fig:real-vs-imaginary

#+caption: *The function $f(x) = x^2$ with real inputs (blue)*\\
#+caption: *and imaginary inputs (green).*
[[file:images/phantom-x2.png]]
#+end_figure

The green parabola in Figure [[fig:real-vs-imaginary]] is what I'm calling
a "phantom parabola" because you don't see it when you only graph real
inputs/outputs of the function. In reality the two plots exist on
separate planes. Since my horizontal axis is doubling as both the
x-axis /and/ the imaginary axis, it's like adding a third dimension to
the XY-plane and then folding it in on itself. You could plot
it in 3D but it's easier to see what's going on when they're drawn
flat. It's also much easier to sketch out by hand that way.

The important thing about phantoms is that—thanks to the imaginary
unit, $i$—they always open in the opposite direction as the real
parabola. So if the real parabola doesn't cross the x-axis—doesn't
have real roots—the phantom /does/ and vice versa. And remember, the
phantom is actually crossing the /imaginary/ axis because the inputs
are imaginary. In other words the roots of the function aren't
imaginary simply because we've found the coefficient for the imaginary
term. The roots are imaginary because they're actually /on/ the
imaginary axis.

#+begin_theorem
_*Geometric Interpretation of Imaginary Roots - The Phantom Parabola*_

Quadratic functions with purely imaginary roots can be thought of as
having a "phantom"—or imaginary—parabola associated with it. For
quadratic function $f$ with minimum (or maximum) point at coordinates
$(0, y_{min})$, the phantom is constructed by reflecting $f$ across
the line $y = y_{min}$.

Then $f$ has imaginary roots if and only if its phantom crosses the
x-axis. The coefficients of the imaginary roots are the roots of the
phantom.

#+end_theorem

*** Complex Inputs
Alright, we're getting there.

Imaginary inputs give us phantoms but what about complex inputs? Well
we can consider pure imaginary inputs as complex inputs $\alpha{} +
\beta{}i$ with $\alpha{} = 0$. So really the phantoms that we've seen
so far represent just a "slice" of the entire function. Pick a
different value of $\alpha{}$, get a different slice.

Let's look at $f(x) = x^2$ again but this time with complex inputs and
different values of $\alpha{}$.

\begin{align*}
f(\alpha{} + \beta{}i) &= (\alpha{} + \beta{}i)^2 \\
&= (\alpha{}^2 - \beta{}^2) + 2\alpha{}\beta{}i
\end{align*}

**** Vector Plot
There are few different ways we can visualize this. The first thing
I'll do is represent the output as vectors.

Let
\begin{align*}
p(\beta{}) &= 2\alpha{}\beta{},& \text{and}\\
q(\beta{}) &= \alpha{}^2 - \beta{}^2
\end{align*}

for some fixed value of $\alpha{}$. Then
\begin{align}
\label{eq:complex-vectors}
r(t) &= (p(t), q(t)),& \forall t \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{align}

I chose $p$ and $q$ the way I did because of how I chose my axes. The
horizontal axis is my imaginary axis so I wanted the imaginary term as
the x-coordinate for my vectors. Plotting those vectors we get this:

#+begin_can
#+html: <canvas id='x2-slices'></canvas><br>
#+html: <input id='x2-slices-slider' type='range' value='1' min='-2' max='2' step='0.1' /><br>
#+html: <label id='x2-slider-label' for='x2-slices-slider'>α = 1</label>
#+end_can

For $\alpha{} + \beta{}i$ to be a root of $f$ we need to find some
vector in (\ref{eq:complex-vectors}) with both components equal to
zero. What we're looking for then is some slice—some value of
$\alpha{}$—where the vector plot passes through the origin. Once we've
found that we've got a value of $\alpha$ for which there is /some/
value of $\beta{}$ which gives us the zero vector. The plot won't tell
us what $\beta$ is but it will help us narrow in on the real part of
the solution. For $f(x) = x^2$ the plot of the vectors of $r$ only passes
through the origin when $\alpha = 0$.

**** Individual Plots
The next thing we can do is plot the real and imaginary parts of the
output as separate functions.

#+begin_can
#+html: <canvas id='x2-slices-complex'></canvas><br>
#+html: <input id='x2-slices-complex-slider' type='range' value='1' min='-2' max='2' step='0.1' /><br>
#+html: <label id='x2-complex-slider-label' for='x2-slices-slider'>α = 1</label>

*The functions $p(\beta) = 2\alpha{}\beta{}$ (red)*\\
*and $q(\beta) = \alpha{}^2 - \beta{}^2$ (green)*
#+end_can

Since $p$ is linear with slope $2\alpha$, when $\alpha = 0$ the slope
is also zero and the line coincides with the x-axis. In fact, no
matter what quadratic we start with, when its $p$ function aligns with
the x-axis, we've found $\alpha$.

More imporantly though, when we find the correct value of $\alpha$,
$q$ becomes the same phantom as the one in Figure
[[fig:real-vs-imaginary]] and its real roots, if it has them, are the
coefficients of the imaginary terms in the roots of $f$. If the
phantom doesn't have real roots then $\alpha{}$ is a real root of
$f$.

Notice that, instead of considering $q$ as a function of $\beta$, we
could consider it a function of $\beta{}i$ without changing anything,
since
\begin{align*}
q(\beta{}i) = \alpha{}^2 + (\beta{}i)^2 = \alpha{}^2 - \beta{}^2.
\end{align*}

Doing that puts $q$ back in complex territory with roots on the
imaginary axis. I don't think that's necessary for building intuition
but I do like that it's an interpretation which is consistent with the
previous section on pure imaginary inputs. But it's probably simpler
to just think of the imaginary parabola finding the coefficients of
the imaginary parts of the roots.

**** Generalizing
Okay that was, I think, a sufficiently thorough dissection of $f(x) = x^2$
so let's see what it looks like when it's a /bit/ more general.

Let $f(x) = x^2 +bx + c$ and apply to $x = \alpha{} + \beta{}i$.
\begin{align}
f(\alpha{} + \beta{}i) &= (\alpha{} + \beta{}i)^2 + b(\alpha{} + \beta{}i) + c \nonumber \\
&= \alpha{}^2 - \beta{}^2 + 2\alpha{}\beta{}i + b\alpha{} + b\beta{}i + c \nonumber \\
&= \alpha{}^2 + b\alpha{} + c - \beta{}^2 + 2\alpha{}\beta{}i + b\beta{}i \nonumber \\
\label{eq:general-complex-solution}
&= (f(\alpha{}) - \beta{}^2) + \beta{}(2\alpha{} + b)i
\end{align}

And then from (\ref{eq:general-complex-solution}) we can take
\begin{align}
\label{eq:complex-p}
p(\beta) &= \beta{}(2\alpha{} + b),& \text{and}\\
\label{eq:complex-q}
q(\beta{}) &= f(\alpha) - \beta{}^2,
\end{align}

and generate the same kind of plots we did before. Notice from
(\ref{eq:complex-q}) that since $q$ doesn't have a linear $\beta$
term, the phantom will /always/ be centered on the y-axis even if
(real valued) $f$ isn't.

#+name: ex:geometric-roots
#+begin_theorem
_*Example - Finding complex roots geometrically*_

Let $f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5$. Then
\begin{align*}
p(\beta) &= \beta{}(2\alpha{} - 2),& \text{and}\\
q(\beta) &= \alpha{}^2 -2\alpha{} + 5 - \beta{}^2.
\end{align*}

As before we'll take the set of vectors
\begin{align*}
r(t) &= (p(t), q(t)),& \forall t \in \mathbb{R}
\end{align*}

and look for a slice of the function where $r$, in purple, passes
through the origin and/or where the slope of $p$, in light blue, becomes
zero.

#+end_can
#+end_theorem

That was a long walk to get somewhere that, at the end of the day,
isn't all that complicated so I wouldn't blame you if you've forgotten
what I was trying to find. I wanted was to show that
(\ref{eq:simplest-quad-formula}), "the simplest quadratic formula,"
was valid for finding both real and complex roots of quadratics. To do
that I need to show that $\alpha{} = x_{min}$ which would mean
$f(\alpha) = y_{min}$.

Setting (\ref{eq:complex-p}) equal to zero gives two possibilities:

1. $\beta = 0$, which would correspond to a real solution, or
2. $2\alpha{} + b = 0$, giving $\alpha = \frac{-b}{2}$ which is the
   definition of $x_{min}$ we found in (\ref{def:x-min}).

Since $\alpha = x_{min}$, $\;f(\alpha) = y_{min}$. Then we can use
(\ref{eq:complex-q}) to find $\beta$.
\begin{align*}
y_{min} - \beta{}^2 &= 0\\
\beta &= \pm \sqrt{y_{min}}.
\end{align*}

With both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have our complex roots at
\begin{align*}
x &= \alpha \pm \beta{}i\\
&= x_{min} \pm i\sqrt{y_{min}}.
\end{align*}

Moving $i$ inside the square root gives
(\ref{eq:simplest-quad-formula}),
\begin{align*}
x &= x_{min} \pm \sqrt{-y_{min}}.
\end{align*}

And with that we can fix Figure [[fig:no-complex-intuition]].

* Loose Ends
** Does it generalize?
All my examples have been of functions like $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ but
I've claimed that /all/ quadratic functions have a phantom. Let's
prove that.

We know that given a quadratic $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we can
always arrange to have another one, $g$, with the same roots.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:equivalent-roots}
g(x) &= \frac{f(x)}{a}.
\end{align}

Since (\ref{eq:equivalent-roots}) is a scaled version of $f$ the
horizontal position of its minimum doesn't change so both $f$ and $g$
have the same $x_{min}$ and therefore the same real part of their
complex solutions. We find the imaginary terms
by solving (\ref{eq:complex-q}) for $g$.

Let $q_g(\beta) = g(x_{min}) - \beta{}^2$. Then
\begin{align}
g(x_{min}) - \beta{}^2 &= 0 \nonumber \\
\frac{f(x_{min})}{a} - \beta{}^2 &= 0,& \text{from } (\ref{eq:equivalent-roots}) \nonumber \\
\label{eq:q-sub-f}
f(x_{min}) - a\beta{}^2 = 0.
\end{align}

We can take the left side of (\ref{eq:q-sub-f}) as a function, $q_f$,
with the same roots as $q_g$.

\begin{align*}
q_f(\beta) = f(x_{min}) - a\beta{}^2.
\end{align*}

The function $q_f$ is precisely the phantom of $f$ and since its roots
are the same as $q_g\text{'s}$, $q_f$ also gives us the imaginary
parts of $f\text{'s}$ roots. So the intuition does hold for all
quadratics.

#+begin_theorem
_*The Quadratic Formula*_

It won't shock you to find out that we can also derive the (normal)
quadratic formula again with the help of function $g$, where

\begin{align*}
g(x) = x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a}
\end{align*}

First find $x_{min}$. Since $f$ and $g$ have the same $x_{min}$ we can
use the formula we already have, which will work for $g$, to find it.

\begin{align*}
x_{min} &= \frac{-b}{2a}.
\end{align*}

Then we can find $y_{min}$.

\begin{align*}
y_{min} &= f(x_{min})\\
&= a\left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right) + b\left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right) + c\\
&= \frac{ab^2}{4a^2} - \frac{b^2}{2a} + c\\
&= \frac{ab^2 - 2ab^2 + 4a^2c}{4a^2}\\
&= \frac{-b^2 + 4ac}{4a}
\end{align*}


The roots are at
\begin{align*}
x &= x_{min} \pm \sqrt{-g(x_{min})}
\end{align*}
which by (\ref{eq:equivalent-roots}) is

\begin{align}
x &= x_{min} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-f(x_{min})}{a}} \nonumber \\
\label{eq:general-simplest-qf}
&= x_{min} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-y_{min}}{a}} \\
&= \frac{-b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{-\frac{-b^2 + 4ac}{4a^2}} \nonumber \\
&= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \nonumber 
\end{align}

Equation (\ref{eq:general-simplest-qf}) is the general form of "the
simplest quadratic formula" and it's only /very slightly/ less simple
than (\ref{eq:simplest-quad-formula}).

As with [[ex:simple-quad-formula][the simple quadratic formula]] you can see that the whole mess
of terms actually /means/ something geometrically. The first part,
$\frac{-b}{2a} = x_{min}$ and the second part, $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 -
4ac}}{2a} = \sqrt{\frac{-y_{min}}{a}}$.

** The Phantom's Fangs
Another way to plot the functions from
(\ref{eq:general-complex-solution}) is to plot the vectors'
/magnitudes./ Then we have a plot that's positive everywhere /except/
at the roots where it equals zero. When you get close to the correct
value of $\alpha$, the graph starts to point directly at the correct
values of $\beta$.

** Higher Order Polynomial Functions
Of course there's no reason why this approach can't be extended to
higher order polynomial functions. We can always generate a pair of
functions as in (\ref{eq:general-complex-solution}) and plot them. For
some polynomial function $f$ of order $m$ we can represent $f$ as the
Taylor Series of $f$ extended to the complex numbers. Although I'll
write it a bit differently than you might expect in order for it to be
in terms of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:complex-taylor}
f(\alpha{} + \beta{}i) &= \sum_{n=0}^m \frac{f^{(n)}(\alpha)(\beta{}i)^n}{n!}
\end{align}
Where $f^{(n)}(\alpha)$ is the $n\text{th}$ derivative of $f$
evaluated at $\alpha$.

All the even terms of (\ref{eq:complex-taylor}) make up the real part
of the solution—what I've previously called $q(\beta)$—and all the odd
terms make up $p(\beta)$ or the imaginary part. These aren't nearly as
intuitive though.

In general the imaginary parts of the roots are found where $p$ and
$q$ intersect both with each other and the x-axis.  The phantom idea
works with quadratics because $p$ is linear and aligns with the x-axis
when we have the correct value of $\alpha$. The points where $q$
intersects $p$ and where $q$ intersects the x-axis are the same 
so we can ignore $p$ for the purposes of building intuition and
concentrate on the "phantom."

For higher order polynomials, neither $p$ nor $q$ will be linear—from
(\ref{eq:complex-taylor}) it's clear that one will always be of order
$m$ and the other of order $m$ minus one—so we can't ignore it. That
and the fact that higher order functions just have more roots makes it
much less obvious how to go about constructing the "phantoms."

But they're still fun to look at so here are the various graphs for
$f(x) = x^5 - 1$.

** Geometric Algebra
I've been playing around with geometric algebra (GA) lately which is
part of what prompted me to consider a geometric interpretation of
complex roots. So when I started exploring this I was doing it in
GA. I decided to stick to complex numbers because that's what most
people are familiar with and people learning it for the first time
probably don't want to learn GA on top of it. There's not much
difference between the two approaches but GA does make one thing more
clear.

I won't go into the details of GA here but, briefly, when I did
similar derivations to the ones above I ended up with this thing which
is a 2D multivector.

\begin{align*}
f(\alpha{} + \beta{}e_{12}) = \alpha{} + \beta{}e_{12} + \beta(2\alpha{} + b)e_1 + (f(\alpha) - \beta{}^2)e_2.
\end{align*}

In GA, $e_{12}$ is called the unit bivector and $(e_{12})^2 = - 1$
making it the GA equivalent of $i$. Similarlly, $\alpha +
\beta{}e_{12}$ is the GA equivalent of a complex number while $e_1$
and $e_2$ are the unit basis vectors of the 2D space: basically the
$\overrightarrow{x}$ and $\overrightarrow{y}$ unit vectors. When we
fix $\alpha$ at some value we can interpret the other three components
as a 3D vector:

\begin{align*}
v = \beta{}(2\alpha{} + b)\overrightarrow{x} + (f(\alpha) - \beta{}^2)\overrightarrow{y} + \beta{}\overrightarrow{z}, \nonumber \\
\end{align*}

with $\overrightarrow{z}$ being the imaginary axis. We can represent
the coefficients as functions of $\beta$:

\begin{align*}
v = p(\beta)\overrightarrow{x} + q(\beta)\overrightarrow{y} + r(\beta{})\overrightarrow{z}
\end{align*}

The $\overrightarrow{x}$ and $\overrightarrow{y}$ components are just
the real and imaginary parts of
(\ref{eq:general-complex-solution}). In the complex case I
/interpreted/ those as vectors but here in GA-land they actually are
the coefficients of the (real) 2D vectors. The three
graphs from the section on [[Complex Inputs]] are generated by taking
every pairing of $p, q$ and $r$ and plotting them parametrically. And
what the GA approach makes clear that the complex number approach
doesn't, in my opinion, is that each of them is just a
2D projection of a set of 3D—or 4D if you want to count
$\alpha$—vectors. Each actually sits on a separate plane.

That's the /real/ reason why I chose the horizontal axis to double as
the imaginary axis when I was exploring [[Pure Imaginary Inputs]]. The
function $q$, which gives us the phantom, is the $\overrightarrow{y}$
component of that 3D vector. When plotting it against the
$\overrightarrow{z}$ (imaginary) component, the vertical axis is
already spoken for, so the imaginary axis has to be horizontal by
default. But by the same argument, when I plot $p$ the imaginary axis
ends up being vertical. That results in a slightly different plot than
we saw before because previously I had rotated it 90° to make the
intersections of $p$ and $q$ obvious. But with the full picture we can
see what's really going on.

With the complex numbers approach I had to be a bit hand-wavy about
how we could think about the imaginary roots being on the imaginary
axis. In this approach there's nothing to justify. The
imaginary roots simply /are/ on the imaginary axis and there's nowhere
else they could be.
